> ☕ Another edition of Coffee and Code, at MT Labs with a twist! Some mentors will focus on helping beginners setup git and GitHub, showcase useful features (GitHub apps, Issues, etc.) and help those that aren't too sure how a commit works and why branches exist.
>
> 🏃 Want to get a head start? Check out our git and GitHub docs: https://sirmerr.github.io/camperbot/#/resources?id=git-and-github
>
> 📚 Already know this stuff? Try contributing to an open source project (such as our discord bot ;D), finish your FCC curriculum, chat with other campers or work on a project of your own.
>
> P.S. We apologize for the recent change of venue and date, and most likely another change to come. We will do our best to secure a stable location as soon as we can!
